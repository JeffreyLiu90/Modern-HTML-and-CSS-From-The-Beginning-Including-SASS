            <p>
              Began my journey into coding by attending LightHouse Lab's
              February Cohort. Learned JavaScript fundamentals and creating a
              web app using Express called TinyApp, which creates shortened
              names for URLs

            </h3>
            <p>
              Learned the basics of HTML & CSS, and using JQuery + JavaScript to
              create a food ordering web app called Ramen Empire. User can order
              food items, checkout, receive a text with approximate order time,
              and view a Google Map that shows the distance from the restaurant
              to the user via different transportation methods such as walking,
              cycling or driving. We also learned about using PostgreSQL.

            </h3>
            <p>
              In the third month of the bootcamp, we learned how to use ReactJS
              to create web apps. We created a web app called Scheduler, which
              the user can use to book appointments with listed individuals. We
              also learned about Ruby on Rails.

            </h3>
            <p>
              On our last month, for our final project we created a web app
              called Kitchen Hero, which provides recipes based on the
              ingredients provided, or picture that was uploaded. It can also
              save the recipes, and keep track of expiry dates of ingredients.
              We used Auth0 Login, Spoonacular API for recipes, Clarifai API for
              picture recognition. We used express as middleware and PostgreSQL
              for backend.
